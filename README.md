### Notes

The Username and Password for MariaDB is: user: *root* password: *password* (I recommend changing the password)

You should change $cfg['blowfish_secret'] in config.inc.php in the phpmyadmin folder for added security.

The SSL Certificate is now generated by Wnmp using VigorTLS. (Now Secure!)
