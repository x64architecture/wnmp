### Notes ######

The Username and Password for MySQL is: user: *root* password: *password* (I recommend changing the password)

You should change $cfg['blowfish_secret'] in config.inc.php in the phpmyadmin folder for added security.

The SSl Certificate is Self Signed by me. For added security create your own.

### FAQ ######

###### Why Does MariaDB take up so much ram? 
It takes up so much ram vs all of the other programs because MariaDB works very well with that configuration. And you can buy 1GB of ram for very cheap.

###### Why use Wnmp over WAMP?
You should use Wnmp over WAMP because Apache is very inefficient. Read more [here][5]. Also there is another reason you should use Wnmp, Wnmp values security, stability and user friendliness. And Wnmp always keeps up to date with the latest Nginx, MariaDB, PHP and phpMyAdmin releases.

###### When will I update this program?
When some of the components get updated to a stable release, if there is a security vulnerability, And if the GUI has bugs or feature enhancements.
